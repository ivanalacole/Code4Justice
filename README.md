# Code4Justice: Design Statement

The website we have created is called Black Butterfly Org. that addresses the issue of African American Suicide

This is a serious issue because: Over the last decade, suicide rates in the United States have increased dramatically among racial and ethnic minorities, and people of color in particular.

The goal of this project is: to provide support and awareness about suicide in the the diaspora of the black and brown community.
