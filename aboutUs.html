          <h3>Did you know?</h3>
          <p>Suicide Among Black Girls Is a Mental Health Crisis Hiding in Plain Sight!Girls of color are increasingly accounting for this trend. According to one 2019 Pediatrics study, the number of white children attempting suicide in the U.S. decreased from 1991 to 2017, while the number of Black children attempting suicide went up. All told, about 15% of Black female high school students attempted suicide in the year leading up to the CDCâ€™s 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, compared to about 9% of white female students and about 12% of Hispanic female students. Actual suicide death rates for Black American girls ages 13 to 19 increased by 182% from 2001 to 2017, according to a 2019 study published in the Journal of Community Health.</p>

          <h3>Suicide Rates Rise in a Generation of Black Youth!!!!</h3>
          <p>Suicide is a devastating problem among Black youth, and researchers and mental health professionals are desperate to understand why and how best to address it. A 2018 study found, for instance, that Black children between the ages of five and 12 are about twice as likely to die by suicide as white children of the same age. The urgency to deal with the issue has only grown more acute. A new study found that suicide rates among Black children and adolescents have recently been worsening: between 2003 and 2017, suicides rose in this group, especially among Black girls, whose rate of increase was more than twice as high as that of Black boys.</p>

          <h3>Depression, Anxiety, Suicide!</h3>
          <p>Black young people are also more at risk of depression, anxiety and stress due to the pandemic, and the recent spotlight on police violence against Black people, according to a December advisory from the U.S. surgeon general. Gun violence, climate change and economic uncertainty also play a role.Black people generally have suffered disproportionately during the pandemic, with higher death rates, higher hospitalization rates and less access to health care, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 brought forth months of intense media coverage of police brutality and racism, which some Black young people said they found deeply stressful.</p>

          <h3>Why are more black kids suicidal?</h3>
          <p>Self-reported suicide attempts rose nearly 80 percent among Black adolescents from 1991 to 2019, while the prevalence of attempts did not change significantly among those of other races and ethnicities. Legislators and academics are now pushing for better research to understand why, especially in light of new evidence that suggests Black children may have unique risk factors for self-harm.</p>
